Chalk is a note taking application for Android that prides itself in being simple and clean. The goal is to allow you to quickly take notes while on the go, and easily sync them with the services you use. For now, the application only supports Ubuntu One, but will include other services in the near future.

This project is still in heavy development, and will be buggy. Please report any bugs you find.
